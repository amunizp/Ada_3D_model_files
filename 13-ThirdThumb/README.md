# Process to get the third thumb.

Using blender and deleting all items not needed from teh blend file. Only finger 0 and the hole in it. Extract that finger as an STL. 
Load the STL file into freeCAD and using the part menu turn the STL file into a part, a solid and a refined solid. 

In order to hold the the third thumb to the palm a strap is done in the bottom.

The pulling of the cord will need to be done via the back of the palm to the original thumb. The original thumb will probably have a ring with a string to pull on it. 

The thumb looked a bit too long so a 10 mm section was removed and the two ends were joined. The inner channel was found to be missalinged slightly so an 2.5 mm diameter cylinder was removed fro the inside to match both ends.
